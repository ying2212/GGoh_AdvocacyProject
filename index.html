            <h2>About My Topic</h2>
            <p>The problem my topic covers is the lack of visibility and support for young entrepreneurs and innovators who are tackling social issues. Many young leaders have groundbreaking ideas but struggle to gain the recognition and resources needed to make a significant impact. This lack of support not only stifles their potential but also limits the positive changes they could bring to society. We can foster a more inclusive environment that encourages innovation and social responsibility.</p>

            <h3>Data about My Topic</h3>
            <img src="img/Chart.jpg" alt="Chart" class="center"/>
            <h4>69.6% of entrepreneurs are 40‚Äì60 years old</h4>
            <p>Numerically speaking, most entrepreneurs fall into the 40- to 60-year-old range. This correlates to Gen X entrepreneurs. The least likely group to be an entrepreneur is young women.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Less than 15% of young entrepreneurs receive adequate funding.</li>
                <li>15%-25% report having access to mentorship programs.</li>
                <li>25%-35% are actively engaged in social entrepreneurship.</li>
                <li>35%-45% believe that their ideas can bring significant change.</li>
                <li>More than 45% face barriers to market entry.</li>

            <h3>Where Can This Problem Have Lasting Effects?</h3>
            <p>This problem can have lasting effects on economic development, social equity, and community resilience. When young entrepreneurs and activists lack the necessary support, it stifles their potential to innovate and drive change. This not only limits their opportunities for success but also affects the communities they aim to uplift. A lack of young voices in leadership roles can lead to a stagnation of ideas and solutions, perpetuating cycles of inequality and hindering progress on critical social issues.</p>

            <h3>Where else can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
            <p>This problem can have lasting effects on digital literacy, online engagement, and the effectiveness of social movements. When young activists face barriers to digital activism, it limits their ability to mobilize support and spread awareness about critical issues. This lack of access to digital tools and platforms can hinder their capacity to influence public opinion and drive change. Furthermore, without a robust digital presence, important movements may struggle to gain traction, resulting in missed opportunities for collective action and meaningful impact in society.</p>

            <h3>Where else else can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
            <p>This problem can have lasting effects on social media dynamics, youth engagement, and societal conversations. When young people face barriers to effectively using social media, it limits their ability to engage in important discussions and advocate for social change. Social media platforms serve as vital spaces for sharing ideas, mobilizing support, and amplifying voices that often go unheard. Without access to these tools, young activists may struggle to influence public perception, which can stifle innovative solutions to pressing social issues and reduce overall community engagement. This lack of representation in online spaces can perpetuate cycles of apathy and disconnection among youth.</p>
